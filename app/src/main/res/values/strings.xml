    <string name="intro">One dark spooky night, you and your friends James and John are playing truth or dare. When it comes to be your turn you choose dare. “I dare you to go into the spooky graveyard across the street!” says James. Not wanting to look like a chicken, you agree. So you walk across the street to the graveyard, while James, and John stand in front of John’s house on the other side. In your way is an imposing iron gate.</string>
    <string name="loose">James and John laugh at you. They call you the biggest chicken of all time. In your shame you become depressed and you fail all your classes, especially OOP. \nTHE END</string>
    <string name="yes">Open the gate.</string>
    <string name="no">Chicken out.</string>

    <string name="court_yard">You put your hand on the iron wrought gate and push, the doors make a sharpened screech as you cross the threshold into the graveyard. You walk a few steps in, but then get a shiver down your spine. You decide that has been enough adventuring for one day and turn back to leave, only for there to be a sharp cold wind, and the deafening sound of the gate slamming behind you. Frightened, you run back to the gate, pulling on it with all of your might, but to no avail, it is sealed shut. You notice a keyhole in the gate and start searching for a key. The clouds part and you see a mysterious decrepit house on the hill. </string>
    <string name="cont">Continue…</string>
    <string name="court_yard2"> As you head up to the house you walk through the graveyard you were dared to go through. You are a little worried because of the entire series of events, but graveyards don’t scare you, after all, they’re just corpes in the ground, they can’t hurt you.
 You continue to walk around the graveyard, observing the epithets that are carved into the ancient headstones. One that gives you a good chuckle reads: “Dear Departed brother Dave, he chased a bear into a cave.” Laughter is the best medicine after all, you feel slightly more at ease.
</string>
    <string name="cy_opt1">Continue exploring the graveyard.</string>
    <string name="cy_opt2">Go up to the front porch of the house.</string>
    <string name="porch">You walk up the rickety, decayed stairs to the front door. You walk forward to the giant imposing wooden door. You decide to be polite and knock to see if anyone is of residence. You give three hard knocks on the door and hear them echo through the hallowed halls within. You wait a while, but there is no answer. You decide to be forceful and let yourself in. You try to turn the doorknob but to no avail. Seems like the door is locked. Better find a key to use.</string>
    <string name="gy_cont"> You continue searching for the graveyard, hoping that maybe the key is somewhere around these graves…</string>
    <string name="gy_cont2"> All of a sudden you hear a rattling sound. You look around, maybe there’s a dog? But no. Around a crypt creeps a skeleton. You are shocked beyond all belief to see this re-animated corpse. It’s skin and muscle completely gone, save for the walking bones. You are frozen in fear, you cannot move to run away. You hear more rattling around you, you are surrounded by these gutless corpses. </string>
    <string name="gy_cont_opt1">Try talking to them.</string>
    <string name="talk">You try talking to the skeletons, seeing if you can reason with them. You tell them you are just lost and need to leave through the gate. There is no physical response. What do you do now?</string>
    <string name="gy_cont_opt2">Tell skeleton jokes.</string>
    <string name="joke1"> You do the only thing that comes to mind, you tell a joke. After all, laughter is the best medicine, and if you want to save your sanity you need to do something to calm you down? Right? So you let one of your best skeleton jokes rip. “Do you guys want to hear a skeleton joke?” you blurt out. The skeletons stop coming towards you and stare at you with their empty sockets. So you decide to deliver the punch line: “Never mind! I don’t have the guts to tell one!”</string>
    <string name="joke2"> The skeletons back away a little, look from one to the other, and look disturbed if that was at all possible without any facial muscles. You feel better, so you decide to tell another one “How did the skeletons deliver their mail in the olden days? By boney-express!” The skeletons begin to back away from you so you decide to hit them with one more joke: “What did the skeleton say while lining his Harley Davidson? I’m bone to be wild!”</string>
    <string name="joke3"> The skeletons, obviously completely put off by your bad jokes, run off over the moor, to where you can only hear the trousle of bones in the distance. A glimmer catches your eye, you look down and see a key shaped like a skeleton, one could even call it a skeleton key? You decide to hold onto it and put it in your backpack.</string>
    <string name="gy_cont_opt3">Try fighting them.</string>
    <string name="fight">You become so afraid you start trying to attack the stack of bones, but to no avail. Bone is stronger than concrete afterall, but you’re too afraid to know or care. You end up hurting your hand, and as the skeletons get even closer to you, you realize you can’t fight them all. So you crouch down and crawl through their femurs and run around them. They realize where you went and start walking towards you once again. </string>

    <string name="gate">You run back to the gate. It is still sealed shut. You try and put the skeleton keyhole in the gates key hole. It doesn’t fit. You figure someone in the house must have the key or at least help you get out, so you set off to the house.</string>

However it got caught in the keyhole and you cannot pull it out, probably best to leave it there, it’s not as if anyone else will be needing it.</string>
